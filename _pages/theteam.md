### Our Team

- **Geet Loomba** – Full-stack developer- lead (Java, JavaFX)  
- **Juan Rempel** – Full-stack developer -  Backend architect (SQLite, data persistence)  
- **Samya Shah** – Full-stack developer - lead for design and testing  
- **Kamau Kiano** - Full-stack developer

## Contributions and Learnings

Each team member contributes unique strengths in software design, testing practices, and user experience. Together, we’re committed to crafting tools that make day-to-day development workflows faster, clearer, and more enjoyable.

- **Geet Loomba:** I significantly enhanced my proficiency in JavaFX by developing a complex user interface from scratch for multiple features, managing various UI components, and dynamically updating the presentation layer based on user interactions and application state. For these features, I also designed the logic layer components and the interfaces for the persistence layers. Further, I gained hands-on experience applying design patterns like factories and performing refactoring to remove code smells, primarily within the front end. Working using an agile system, I did in code reviews and was surprised to learn how difficult it is to perform code review! It’s genuinely a skill that one must hone and I really hope to get better at it. I refined my own code based on  suggestions which improved the quality my code as well. I also honed my Git skills by managing branches, and resolving merge conflicts. Overall, I gained valuable experience working across different project layers and adapting my code to integrate effectively with teammates' contributions, truly deepening my software engineering skills.
- **Samya Shah:** Strengthened skills with GitLab and version control, and learned how to structure code effectively into multiple layers and classes. Gained experience collaborating on a multi-developer project, writing comprehensive Java unit tests, and working with the persistence layer and database configuration. Also gained exposure to the logic layer by implementing user input validation and updating the presentation layer dynamically, such as changing a textbox color to red for invalid input. Improved code quality through regular code reviews of teammates’ merge requests and by refining my own code based on peer feedback. Additionally, contributed to refactoring code by extracting hardcoded values into constants and organizing them in a separate configuration file.
- **Juan Rempel:** Gained practical experience in release management by overseeing the release process for each iteration, handling versioning, coordinating merges, and resolving late-stage conflicts. Became deeply familiar with Git workflows in a collaborative environment, regularly troubleshooting merge conflicts, branching issues, and team sync problems. Strengthened full-stack development skills through consistent work across the persistence, logic, and presentation layers, and developed a better understanding of how evolving architectural seams impact integration. Took the lead on writing unit, integration, and system tests, and gained hands-on experience using a UI testing robot to simulate user interaction and identify interface-level issues.
- **Kamau Kiano:** I gained a lot of experience in this project. Particularly, experience working on a team from design, implementation to testing. The challenges we faced while working on this project is what taught me the most lessons since those challenges are things I overlooked or just didn’t know about. For instance, the modularity of this project gave me insight on how to effectively design an application in a way that abstracts the layers from each other. I faced challenges with dependency injections as most of my previous assignments during my university career have been designed and ready to implement, and it usually didn’t span across different packages and layers. I mostly worked on the front end using Java-FX for design and Java for functionality. I gained key insight on how Java-FX works and how it can be used to build beautifully crafted UI. Additionally, implementing factories in our project was one of the most valuable learning experiences I gained. Finally, this project taught me many things that I will now carry with me throughout my software engineering career!
